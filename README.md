# FotoFindur - Find ur fotos!

FotoFindur is a simple one-page application that enables the user to search for images by keyword via the Unsplash API. It was created in JavaScript using the Vue framework, which I had never used before.

Visit https://fotofindur.herokuapp.com/ to view the live app.

## Goals

* Demonstrate ability to learn a new framework or technology without guidance
* Demonstrate front-end engineering knowledge gained during time at Turing
* Demonstrate professional workflow habits (effective commits, use of project management tools, etc.)
